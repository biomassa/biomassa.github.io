i've been trying to find ways to incorporate direct political statements into my music. most of the noises i make nowadays are synthesized or sampled from banging on random objects, so i thoroughly failed.

well here's the idea: all the music i make is leftist, queer, anti-totalitarian, pro-liberal. i stand with Ukraine.
