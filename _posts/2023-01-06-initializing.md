after moving to israel i've been looking for ways to self release my own noises. in the past i tried submitting my stuff to labels (to no avail), releasing on streaming platforms (have a guess lol) etc. this here is a little experiment – semi-private micronetlabel slash microblog, an addition to the [bandcamp] that will cover updates, prose, images – if we need. i'd be happy to represent other musicians here and on our bandcamp so drop me an email if that idea sounds good to you. we'll take it from here and see where it goes.
