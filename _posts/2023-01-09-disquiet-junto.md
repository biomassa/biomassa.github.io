feels lovely to remind myself and others of the existence of [disquiet junto](https://disquiet.com/2012/01/27/the-disquiet-junto/){:target="_blank"} — an "association for communal music/sound-making since January 2012", as the founder and maintainer [Mark Weidenbaum](https://disquiet.com/){:target="_blank"} puts it. you [subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/disquiet-junto){:target="_blank"} to a mailing list (ok boomer?) and start to receive weekly "challenges" of varying complexity and degree of social involvement. each results in a deadlined creation of a piece that is [published](https://soundcloud.com/disquiet/sets){:target="_blank"} with the works of other participants.
now, i've done a few of them myself. it does feel like an accomplishment and provides a nudge to come out of a "creative block" (whatever that means). highly recommended!
